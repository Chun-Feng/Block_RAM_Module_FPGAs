# Block_RAM_Module_FPGAs
Block RAMs (BRAMs) provide two types: two ports or dual-ports mode on FPGAs.


Xilinx Virtex-7 XC7V585 FPGA contains 79,536 KB BRAMs, 

and each BRAM can be configures as two port mode or dual-port mode.

Designs can utilize these memory blocks to implement the on-chip storage module in a design.

Reference: Xilinx and FPGAs Zedboard guideline techniques.
